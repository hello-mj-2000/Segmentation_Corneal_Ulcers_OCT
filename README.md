# Segmentation_Corneal_Ulcers_OCT
This project presents a Python algorithm that segments and analyzes corneal lesions from OCT B-scans. Combining the Sobel operator and a weighted moving average, it detects contours, estimates curvature, and computes lesion volumes in under 10 seconds, potentially improving corneal bioprinting precision.
